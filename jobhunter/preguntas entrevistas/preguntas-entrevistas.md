**1) Tell me about yourself:**

I'm an ex opera singer, I used to work in the choir of Stralsund opera house. But I was learning to program by myself and It was really taking all my mind at the point that I started to think that it was really my vocation, even more than singing that is something that I really love.

All my life I have done things that I love, not just sing but also I like doing martial art. I am 3er Dan in aikido and a blue belt in BJJ and probably most of my soft skills come from martial arts.

I am from Argentina, my father is a businessman and as you probably know Argentina has an eternal inflation problem and we have gone through many crises because of that. And I have seen my father going bankrupt and starting from scratch many times. And also I saw my father making really good money, just because he loves working and because he is really passionate about what he does. I think I learned a lot from him and when I decided to change career I was not broke, I had a stable job but I wanted to start again. And of course, I was not afraid because I knew how to do that I have seen that all my life and the secret is just, to love what you are doing, working hard and even you need to be smart, sensible.

I really like reading books, I always read a lot of novels, books on philosophy, political theory, and poetry. Probably what I most enjoy reading is poetry, because poetry needs a lot of the reader's engagement and sensitivity. But in the last years, I have read a lot about python, machine learning and about how to change habits as wel.

And regarding computers I really like them and I wanted the learn IT security and 4 years ago I was talking with a cousin of mine who is a programmer and he says to me, not! what you have to do is to learn to program with PHP and python..... ok... I started to learn php and then I discovered data science and I fell totally in love with it and it also has something that I like a lot and it is math.


**2) What is your greatest strength.**

I am a person who really likes processes, the process that leads someone to become a data analyst, a team to reach its goals. How people, teams, mentality, environment, habits work towards achieving a task.
I am also a person who really likes to create spaces where others feel safe to be themselves.
I think I have an analytical mindset and quite creative at the same time. So I am always looking for alternative or new ways to do a task or find an answer.

(Pensar en algo tecnico tambien)

**3) What is your greatest weakness?**

I think that because I like to program a lot, sometimes I learn many things at the same time.
And this is often not "directly" related  to data anlytics. For example last week I was learning the framework Django creating rest apis and I spent long hours on it. And sometimes it is also hard to control  how many hours I devote to my work.  
when that happens I go to bed late  and I don't sleep enough. And there is a moment where I feel that my mind and my eyes are really tired. 
But now I am creating tasks and doing a week plan to organize my time better, and also I am doing breathing exercises before sleeping to disconnect from my day and to prepare my body to sleep better. 
I am trying to create more positive habits, and start giving up all these habits that in a simple view look like good ones, because learning is allways good. But they are no so effective. I am reading a book called atomic habits to change my mind in a better way.


**4) Why should we hire you ?

I am a guy who really likes creating safe environments, a place where you can be yourself and feel comfortable. I am empathic. And I have the feeling that in all the places where I worked people used to like me and It is something that I am really proud of. For me to respect everyone is one of the most important things in my life. And then because I like working, I enjoy going to work, and I am someone who is always thinking in a creative way. And I am always trying to find the faster and most efficient way to do the tasks.

Y porque creo que me siento muy comodo con (la tarea especifica de la empresa para la que estoy postulando) y que podria traer nuevas ideas en esto.



**5) Why do you want to work here?**


**6) Tell me about a time you showed leadership.**

**7) Tell me about a time you were successful on a team.**
 
Well this is not related to business but I use to teach aikido in the school that I used to train and my class was one of the most popular classes, and not because I was the most skilled guy but because I use to prepared my classes and I use to think a lot in what I was doing or what I was feeling during the technique and how to explain that and It was a kind of double motivation because the guys were coming to my classes because I was really enjoying teaching and for myself, I was feeling really nice energy from the guys who were following me. And of course, teaching is also a good way to learn.
A couple of years ago I was in Argentina and I went to this school to visit a friend who was teaching there and a black belt that I didn't know approached me and said "you are a legend here" 

**8) What would your co-workers say about you?**

I wish my co-workers would be here. Because it would sound less arrogant if they talk about me. But I think they would say that I am a gay who is always working, as an ex opera singer I use to go to the theater even the day that I didnt have to work just to sing, to keep in shape my voice, and always looking to sing better. I think they would also say that I am a easy going guy with always a very good humor. 

**9)  What do you want to leave your current role?**

**10)  Describe your most challenging project**

as a Data Analyst a did a case study with imbalance data wich was really complicate because the data was really imbalance an traying to balance the data a bit with sintetic data was not enough so I had to look for the best features, then the best hyperparameters and It was not easy. But I am happuy with the results because I learned a lot.

**11)  Tell me about something you’ve accomplished that you are proud of. **

**12)  Can you explain your employment gap?**

**13)  What are your salary expectations?**
Well, I was watching on glassdoor and payscale that the avg salary for a junior data analyst is 42000 euros per year and I think is a good salary, I know that I don't have experience working as a data analyst but I know how hard I work and I also know that I going to learn fast and if I don't get the salary that matches how the effort that I put I know that in a couple of weeks when I have learned all my tasks I will feel that my salary is not fair

**14) What do you like to do outside of work?**

Now because the pandemic I am not doing martial arts I am just running and doing some workup, and every Saturday I run with some friends in Teufelberg and then we do Ice Bath in the lake. I have also my family and I really enjoy having time with them. I also play chess and ones a week I meet a friend in a bar and we play chess.

**15) Tell me about a time you had to manage conflicting priorities.**

**16) Where do you see yourself in 5 years.**

In 5 years I see myself being a very good Data Scientist, with good knowledge also as a data engineer. I also always felt that without being a boss I had some kind of leadership among my co-workers. Now I would like to start taking a more active role as a leader and start taking responsibility. I would very much like in 5 years to have learned to be a good leader, in whom people believe and trust.

**17) Describe your leadership style.**
In am a guy who doesnt have big ego problems, I don't have self-esteem problems, and in some
